# Final Project Journal Entry

## [Project](../JS/infernum.html)

For my final project I made another game. This game was much harder to make, and I included a few higher level features like delta time, to make the physics framerate independent, and keybindings, in case you want to change what keys you use to move, jump, and dash.

The game itself is a bullethell game where you dodge a bunch of fast telegraphed attacks. That's about it, it's a pretty simple idea, but the attacks are where it gets hard to make.
