My form has input types of email for their email, datetime-local for when the reservation is, and number for how many people they need. The request method is POST since it would just tell the server when the reservation is, but it would also have a GET request in another spot to show what time slots are already in use.

Overall it went pretty well, collaborating mostly went well except gabe didn't start until late and when he did start it messed with the tree and caused lots of conflicts that I had to resolve. We didn't really use branches because they weren't needed and they can cause those same conflicts that gabe caused.
