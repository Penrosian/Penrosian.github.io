We learned about a few different "modifiers" of functions.
You can translate or dilate functions in various different ways.

## 1. Translation

![Translations](../../images/Translation.png)
The two marked numbers are translations that move the origin of the function. 
The one attached to the X value is a translation on the X axis. 
This one is reversed, so x-7 actually increases the X value of the origin by 7.
The one attached to the Y value is a translation on the Y axis.
This one is normal, so + 5 increases the Y value of the origin by 5.

## 2. Dilation

The marked number is the factor of dilation. The higher the factor, the more the Y value changes per increase in the X value.
This "stretches" the function upwards.
