Today I learned more about markdown and added a new section to my website.

Across the last few days, Mr. Jones taught us about

- The terminal
   - Similar between Mac and Linux
   - Very useful for a lot of things that you can't do in just finder, especially with MacOS's limitations
- Vim
   - Learned how to modify files with it, and quit it
   - My stance hasn't changed I am using nano to write this journal entry right now
- Git
   - Used to make changes to a remote GitHub repo
   - I only really use it so that I can use source control on VS
- # Markdown
   - This file is written in markdown
   - You can do some pretty cool things with it, such as [Back to Journal](index.md)
