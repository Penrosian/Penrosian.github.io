Since scam websites aren't exactly readily available to look at and I didn't have much time, I just looked through some of the wordpress templates instead. I noticed that they all had a couple of different blocks on the home page with images and words, so I used that in my website. I also used multiple buttons, just like I saw on the templates.

Using wordpress was pretty easy. I got a website I am happy with, so that is a win. It wasn't super difficult either. The blocks they had available were enough and uploading images was super easy too, with some blocks having built-in image spots.
